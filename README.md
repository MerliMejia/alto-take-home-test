This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## DISCLAIMERS:
- The requirements says to use local storage, I decided to use a basic Next.JS backend so it is more "real life like", it is more easy to use with React and to showcase some of my Backend Skills.
- I tried to use as less third party libraries as possible so I can showcase my CSS and React skills. That's the reason I created my own styled component based UI library for this project.

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
